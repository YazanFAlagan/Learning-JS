# Learning-JS

This repository contains my tasks and exercises as I learn JavaScript, specifically through my participation with Enactus.
The focus is on hands-on coding challenges that involve using JavaScript for web development.

## Projects

- **Task 1: Calculate Power of Numbers**
  - This task prompts the user to enter a list of numbers and their corresponding powers, then calculates the result of raising each number to the given power. 
    The results are logged to the console using JavaScript's `Math.pow()` function. 
    It allows for easy testing and exploring of mathematical operations in JavaScript.

- **Task 2: Set Color and Font Size**
  - A simple web page that allows the user to change the color and font size of paragraphs.

- **Task 3: LoginPage with JS & Tailwind**
  - This task evaluates the password against five requirements (length, numeric characters, lowercase, special symbols, and uppercase letters) and classifies the password strength into three levels:
    - **Low**: Red border and text "Low" if 2 or fewer conditions are met.
    - **Medium**: Orange border and text "Medium" if 3 to 4 conditions are met.
    - **High**: Green border and text "High" if all 5 conditions are met.
