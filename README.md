# Learning-JS

This repository contains my tasks and exercises as I learn JavaScript, specifically through my participation with Enactus.
The focus is on hands-on coding challenges that involve using JavaScript for web development.

## Projects

- **Task 1: Calculate Power of Numbers**

- This task prompts the user to enter a list of numbers and their corresponding powers, then calculates the result of raising each number to the given power. 
  The results are logged to the console using JavaScript's `Math.pow()` function. 
  It allows for easy testing and exploring of mathematical operations in JavaScript.

- **Task 2: Set Color and Font Size**
  - A simple web page that allows the user to change the color and font size of paragraphs.
